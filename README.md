#Weather Prediction App

This project integrates real-time weather data with machine learning models to create an interactive and predictive weather forecasting platform. The system retrieves live weather conditions for user-specified locations using the OpenWeatherMap API and combines this data with historical climate records to make informed predictions about rain probability, future temperatures, and humidity levels.

By employing techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training using Random Forest classifiers and regressors, the project bridges real-time meteorology with predictive analytics. Users can interact with the platform through an intuitive interface, input current weather conditions, and receive future trends presented in a user-friendly format.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can enhance weather prediction, providing a foundation for practical applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, and urban planning.
